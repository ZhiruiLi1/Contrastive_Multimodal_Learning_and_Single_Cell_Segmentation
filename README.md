Three selected research experiences at Singh Lab. The most recent one is the development of the contrastive learning model, which aligns multiple modalities into a unified embedding space, realizing zero-shot classification and cross-modal retrieval. The other two, Gumbel Softmax and Slot Attention, are related to enhanced single-cell segmentation.
