Three selected research experiences at Singh Lab. The most recent one is the development of the contrastive learning model, which aligns multiple modalities into a unified embedding space, realizing zero-shot classification, image-image, and image-text retrievals. The other two, Gumbel Soft-max and Slot Attention, are related to enhanced single-cell segmentation.
